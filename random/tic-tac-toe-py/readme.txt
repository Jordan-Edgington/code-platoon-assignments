# This program was created by prompting chatGPT and not by my actual coding.
# Any changes were made by asking chatgpt to modify a function.

The below notes are a brief outline of possible features for the game.
We outlined the game prior to asking chatGPT to build us individual functions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create a Tic Tac Toe Terminal game in Python
# by utilizing prompt engineering concepts to
# generate a series of prompts that will allow
# you to accomplish this task.

# Features:

# High-level features:
# - Human player turn
# - Computer player turn
# - Getting human player input
# - Printing the board for the human player to see
# - Check after every move to see if:
#  - Someone one
#  - Tie game


# Computer AI, we can do Player vs Computer. We'd like to to be smart
# but we can start with it being dumb and simple.
# - Computer making its move

# User input:
# - User inputs their move for each turn:
# - Maybe we do this by user inputting row and column for their move.
# - Ask the user if they want to be "x" or "o"

# Show the board with the current state of the game

# Flow of game
# - Who goes first? Player A
# - Player A makes their move
# - Now it's palyer B's turn, and player B makes their move
# - ... and so on ...

# Human Player
# - Need to be able to see the board
# - Prompt for their move
#  - We need to tell the user how to enter their move

# Computer Player
# - Randomly plays its move
# - Needs to knwo spots available, or, if randomly generated move is valid or not
